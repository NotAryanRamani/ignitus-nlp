# <center> Customer Sentiment  </center>

This initiative focuses on the examination of customer sentiment within Amazon reviews through the application of diverse analytical models. Specifically, our approach incorporates logistic regression, multinomial naive Bayes, and advanced transformer-based sentiment analysis models. By leveraging these sophisticated methodologies, we aim to derive nuanced insights into customer opinions, thereby facilitating a comprehensive understanding of the prevailing sentiments expressed in Amazon reviews. This project aligns with the broader goal of enhancing customer experience analysis and contributing valuable insights for strategic decision-making processes.
